    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Just a couple of days ago, the term “version control” meant nothing more than its most basic definition - controlling or keeping track of different versions of a document, git was just a quicker way of saying GitHub, and GitHub was a website full of terms I didn’t understand that my coding friends would name-drop when geeking out. After a full day of research and command line coding challenges, I’ve begun to understand the importance of version control in the coding world

    <h3>Storing code with GitHub</h3>
        <p>
            Storing code remotely on GitHub makes the files easily accessible for you and for your collaborators while. GitHub also provides built in documentation tools and saves a history of all changes committed to the master repository. In addition to this, GitHub is a great way to build a portfolio that allows users to easily share projects they have completed which can be very helpful for gaining employment (or just showing off...).

<!--
-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  <section> and <main> because it's a clean way to organize the document

-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements should get laid out on the page in a logical formate with the header at the top and the main content following underneath. The browser reads the html from top to bottom. header -> main -> sidebar -> navigation menu -> footer

-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
    Snippets are awesome! I definitely will create more snippets at some point. I just googled sublime shortcuts - there are so many!
