# Build a simple guessing game


# I worked on this challenge by myself.
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input:
# Output:
# Steps:
1. Initialize class with an integer
2. Define an instance method which takes an integer (guess) as its input.
  - guess returns :high IF guess > answer
  - guess returns :correct IF guess = answer
  - guess returns :low IF guess < answer
3. Define an instance method (GuessingGame.solved?)
  - returns true IF most recent guess = correct
  - ELSE returns false


# Initial Solution

class GuessingGame
  def initialize(answer)
    # Your initialization code goes here
  end

  # Make sure you define the other required methods, too
end
