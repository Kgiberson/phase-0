- Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
    Creating a repository on GitHub is fairly easy. Login to your account, click the "+" then "new repository" at the top right of your window, choose a name, decide if you want it to be public or private, decide on a license, then click "Create repository."
    To clone the repository to your local computer, copy the URL of you repository found on the GitHub page. Then, open up your Terminal application, navigate to the appropriate directory, and type "git clone [URL_here]."
- Describe what open source means.
    Open source software is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to cutomize the program. Software that is open source produces community-built/community-added products.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
    I think Open Source is an inspiring approach to developing better programs and creating a healthy, collaborative environment for all developers to learn. I can also understand how it's not conducive for all companies to open source their code.
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
    A license is important for granting specific permissions for others to use your work. It is a great alternative to releasing your work into the public domain, because you are able to maintain your copyright rights, or granting permissions on a case-by-case basis, which can take a lot of time.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
    The workflow and concept of pushing and pulling between the local git  and the remote github repositories became more fluid and better understood with repetition through this challenge.
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
    I'll echo the git tutorial (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) shared by the TA/fellow student.
