# 1.1 Thinking about Time Reflection
The time management tool I spent the most time researching was the pomodoro method - where you cycle through 25 minutes of focused-work followed by a 2-5 minute break, repeating and taking a longer break every 4th cycle. A "time box" is a previously agreed period of time during which an individual or team works steadily towards completing a goal. Instead of working continuously until the goal is achieved, you stop work when the time limit is reached.

I'm currently employing the Pomodoro method and it's been a smashing success. I hope to bring meditation back into my every day and have decided to challenge myself to meditate 5-15 minutes at least 5 times a week during Phase 0 (Fogg method - specific & achievable).

Time Management Plan: At the start of each week I will read through the challenges and decide what should be tackled first. Then I'll evaluate my coming week's schedule and block out chunks of time dedicated to no-distraction, Phase 0 time. I will continue using the Pomodoro method.

# 1.2 The Command Line
A shell is a user interface that allows access to an operating system's services. "Bash" is the command language we used in the terminal application. I found pipes and redirection to be the most challenging topics covered in the crash course but it was helpful to read the code out loud and explain what the symbols meant. I didn't spend enough time on sudo or chmod, but I plan on revisiting these commands. For me, the combination of "find" and the wildcard matching (asterisk) is the most useful command I've learned so far. I imagine that "pushd" and "popd" will become important in the near future.

-pwd = print working document, use to determine where you are in the command line

-ls = list files and directories

-mv = move a file or directory

-cd = change directory, navigate "up" or "down" tree

-../ = used to move "up" in the tree/path

-touch = used to create new empty files in the command line

-mkdir = make a directory

-less = page through a file

-rmdir = remove a directory

-rm = remove a file

-help = find info about commands

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Hi new GitHub user. To create a new repository please navigate to your github.com profile. At the top right of the window you should see a “+” between the notification bell and your avatar. Click the “+” and select “new repository.” On the new repository page, choose a name, select whether you would like it to be public or private, and add a license if you have one then click “Create repository.”
To fork a repository means to create a separate, distinct copy of the repo on your own GitHub account. Forking is more useful than creating a new repository if you find an interesting repo that you’d like to work on. From the USERNAME/FORKED_REPO page, click “Fork,” found below your avatar, next to the star button. You can tell if the repo was successfully forked if your username precedes the repository name.
To clone a repository locally (to copy it onto your computer) open up your terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g. phase-0). Next, go back to your github account and copy the HTTP URL of your Forked repo to your clipboard. Return to the terminal and write > git clone URL_THAT_YOU_COPIED.
I’ve found the combinations of videos and written instructions/explanations really helpful in understanding the differences between git and GitHub and their applications.
