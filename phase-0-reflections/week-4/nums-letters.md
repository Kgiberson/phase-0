**What is an integer? What is a float?**
  An integer is a whole number, no decimal point. A float has a decimal point and is used in academia.
**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
  Float division can return non-integer numbers, while integer division always returns integers and rounds down. Integers are used often in programming, eg you expect to see 5 emails in your inbox, not 5.2.

```ruby
puts 24*365
puts (24*60)*3650
```
