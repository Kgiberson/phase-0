**What does puts do?**
  puts writes on the screen whatever comes after it

```ruby
puts 24*365
puts (24*60)*3650
```

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**
For addition and subtraction, we use + and -, for multiplication we use *, and for division we use /. We can run the results using print or puts.


**What is the difference between integers and floats?**
  An integer is a whole number, no decimal point. A float has a decimal point and is used in academia.


**What is the difference between integer and float division?**
  Float division can return non-integer numbers, while integer division always returns integers and rounds down. Integers are used often in programming, eg you expect to see 5 emails in your inbox, not 5.2.


**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**
  A string is a finite groups of letters (can also have punctuation, digits, symbols, and spcaes in them) that function as objects. They are the mechanism by which applications communicate with users. You can use strings to define variables that you wish to run through your program.


**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**
  A local variable has a name starting with a lower case letter or an underscore character. They do not have the value, nil, before initialization. Local variables are used to store strings in your computer's memory for use later in your program.


**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
  It was a good re-introduction to Ruby. I enjoyed reading Chris Pine's book.
