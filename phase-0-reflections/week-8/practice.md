Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
  My boyfriend has planned a fun trip to Tahoe for this coming weekend. It should be great and I should be excited. There will be fresh snow, we will have a free place to stay, and I'll get to meet one of his good friends for the first time.


What was the source of the conflict?
  I can't quite tell where my hesitation/lack of excitement is coming from. We're staying with his family friends, a successful couple who I've met before.
  Here are some possible sources of conflict:
      - I'm not convinced that they like me, I had a few awkward encounters the weekend we met because I'm socially anxious at times.
      - I don't like the idea of relinquishing my weekend to their control & schedule. I work hard all week, and being "on" all weekend sounds exhausting.
      - I don't feel super welcome, probably because I wasn't involved in the planning at all.
      - I don't love skiing. And I assume that they all do. My reasons for not liking are complex. I view it as a rich person's activity. I hate the idea of dropping 100+ dollars to go down a mountain, fearing injury the whole time. I hate that everyone else on the mountain so clearly LOVES it.
        - My last experience with skiing was definitely my WORST experience with skiing. I didn't want to go. I did it to spend time with friends. The conditions were horrible. I went down once and never went up again. I was mad for giving in to my friends. I was mad that I spent so much money on a stupid experience surrounded by stupid snobby people. I think I'm sensitive about the fact that the people who are good at skiing usually come from money.
        - I don't want to change the plan. I want people to ski/snowboard if that's what they want to do. I just don't want to have to do it.
What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
  I feel hurt, confused, upset, angry with myself and the situation, frustrated.
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
  Writing out this reflection is the action I am taking to resolve this conflict. I've realized that the true source of conflict is that I don't want to downhill ski. It's expensive and elitest. I'm clearly angry and emotional about it still. I hope my feelings towards it change in my lifetime, but for now it's good to acknowledge this.
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
  I will talk to Ryan during lunch to express what's going on in my mind.
What did you learn from this experience?
  Taking the time to flesh out what I'm feeling and where it might be coming from is extremely rewarding. I feel so much better now than I did 20 minutes ago. There seems to be a pattern that the reason that I get most emotional over, is probably the most important truth that I need to acknowledge and release. This is reminding me of Tara Brach.
